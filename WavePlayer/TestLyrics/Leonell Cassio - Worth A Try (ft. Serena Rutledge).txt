We touch, we brak
Make it seem like we feel the same
We love what we hate
We lie, but we know
We can't water what doesn't grow
Give up, let go

Well we fell apart just in time
You said at least it was worth a try
At least it was worth a try
At least it was worth a try

I drive from your place
Miss your lips but I hate the taste
No fun in this game
Our call, our bluff
Cause using bodies isn't good enough
Slow down this ain't love

Well we fell apart just in time
You said at least it was worth a try
At least it was worth a try
At least it was worth a try

We keep playing games
Can't go separate ways
Break up all the same
We keep playing games
Can't go separate ways
Break up all the same

Well we fell apart just in time
You said at least it was worth a try
At least it was worth a try
At least it was worth a try
