Your demon has, stripped back your memories
And set you up to take the fall
And in your mind, the clouds have been gathering
You may feel hopeless but I'll never let you go

Fly through the stratosphere and then
I'll rip him screaming from your, soul
Oh we'll watch him fall

Ooooohhhhhwoooo

Now your clouds are all gone
Come on send your light through
Just send your light through before
We're only whispers in the wind

Today may be, the last time, I get to say
Your life's had meaning and you're mattered most
The way you hold me like, I am your everything
Has burned inside me, so we'll never be apart

Fly through the stratosphere and then
I'll rip him screaming from your soul
Oh we'll watch him fall

Ooooohhhhhwoooo

Now your clouds are all gone
Come on send your light through
Just send your light through before
We're only whispers in the wind

Oooooohhhh
Ooooohhhhhhh
Oooohhhhhhh
Now!

Not today

Fly through the stratosphere and then
I'll rip him screaming from your soul
Oh we'll watch him fall

Ooooohhhhhwoooo

Now your clouds are all gone
Come on send your light through
Just send your light through before
We're only whispers in the wind
