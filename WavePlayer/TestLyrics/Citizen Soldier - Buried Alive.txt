Shaking hands, cannot catch my breath
It's 3 a.m. and I'm scared to death
My darkest side has come alive
Can't hide the hell I live in every day
You say its just a phase, I'll be okay
What you can't feel, must not be real

I wear my heart here on my sleeve
But you can't see, no one sees

This is killing me, I can barely breathe
No one knows what's inside of me
(Still I can't)
Too late to fit in, don't you dare pretend you know what it's like
To watch the world outside while you're buried alive

Six feet under still no one can hear
My cry for help falling on deaf ears
So desperate for your attention whore
Tell me why anyone would pretend
And choose a life they would want to end
And ever feed this anxiety

Here on the surface everything seems fine
But here beneath my skin I'm running out of time

This is killing me, I can barely breathe
No one knows what's inside of me
(Still I can't)
Too late to fit in, don't you dare pretend you know what it's like
To watch the world outside while you're buried alive

Faceless, I've been paralyzed
I won't be silent one more day
I've come too far to say I'm sorry
I will live to tell my story
(I will live to tell my story)

This is killing me, I can barely breathe
No one knows, no one knows
Too late to fit in, don't you dare pretend you know what it's like
To watch the world outside while you're buried alive

This is killing me
I can barely breathe
No one knows, no one knows me
(To watch the world outside while you're buried alive)
(To watch the world outside while you're buried alive)
