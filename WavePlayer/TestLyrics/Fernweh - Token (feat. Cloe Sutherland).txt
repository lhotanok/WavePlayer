Stuck in a loop
Lovin' and fightin' this group
Of emotions
They're broken
I'm holdin' but chokin

Searching for affection
But searchin' isn't findin'
Sit back and relax 'cause love is blindin'
Searching for affection
But searchin' isn't findin'
Sit back and relax 'cause love is blindin'

It's a strange world we live in
All we want is lovin'
Searchin' for things unspoken
But we can't hold this token

It's a strange world we live in
All we want is lovin'
Searchin' for things unspoken
But we can't hold this token

Touch the fire
Burn your hands with the desire
Of the future
It's hopeless
Endless battle
And we're losin'

Searching for affection
But searchin' isn't findin'
Sit back and relax 'cause love is blindin'
Searching for affection
But searchin' isn't findin'
Sit back and relax 'cause love is blindin'

It's a strange world we live in
All we want is lovin'
Searchin' for things unspoken
But we can't hold this token

Stick to the trail, no
Don't go off the path
Goin' in a circle
Lost and no going back
Lost and we're not going back

Searching for affection
But searchin' isn't findin'
Sit back and relax 'cause love is blindin'
Searching for affection
But searchin' isn't findin'
Sit back and relax 'cause love is blindin'

It's a strange world we live in
All we want is lovin'
Searchin' for things unspoken
But we can't hold this token
