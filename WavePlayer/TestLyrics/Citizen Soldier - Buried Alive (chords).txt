[Intro]
A F G Am
 
N.C.
(To watch the world outside while you're buried alive)
 
Am F G    Am F G
 
[Verse]
 
Am
Shaking hands, cannot catch my breath
F
It's 3am and I'm scared to death
  C                 G
My darkest side has come alive
Am
Can't hide the hell I live in every day
F
You say its just a phase, I'll be okay
    C                        G
What you can't feel, must not be real
 
[Pre Chorus]
 
F
I wear my heart here on my sleeve
G
But you can't see, no one sees
 
[Chorus]
 
Am                  F
This is killing me, I can barely breathe
C                     G
No one knows what's inside of me
 
(Still can't)
 
 Am                  F                     C
Too late to fit in, don't you dare pretend you know what it's like
             G
To watch the world outside while you're buried alive
 
[Inturlude]
Am F G
 
[Verse 2]
 
Am
Six feet under still no one can hear
F
My cry for help falling on deaf ears
   C                  G
So desperate for your attention whore
Am
Tell me why anyone would pretend
F
And choose a life they would want to end
C                  G
And ever feed this anxiety
 
[Pre Chorus]
 
F
Here on the surface everything seems fine
G                                           E
But here beneath my skin I'm running out of time
 
[Chorus]
 
Am                  F
This is killing me, I can barely breathe
C                   G
No one knows what's inside of me
 
(Still can't)
 
Am                   F                     C
Too late to fit in, don't you dare pretend you know what it's like
             G
To watch the world outside while you're buried alive
 
[Bridge]
 
F
Faceless, I've been paralyzed
 G
I won't be silent one more day
 F
I've come too far to say I'm sorry
 G
I will live to tell my story
 Gm
(I will live to tell my story)
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Am                  F
This is killing me, I can barely breathe
C      G      N.C.
No one knows, no one knows
Am                  F                      C
Too late to fit in, don't you dare pretend you know what it's like
             G
To watch the world outside while you're buried alive
 
[Post Chorus]
 
 Am
(Six feet under still no one can hear)

   C                   G
(So desperate for your attention whore)
 G
(To watch the world outside while you're buried alive)
 
Am
This is killing me
F
I can barely breathe
C             G
No one knows, no one knows me
 
Am     F                  G                  Em
     (To watch the world outside while you're buried alive)
